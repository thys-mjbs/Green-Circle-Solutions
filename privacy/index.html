      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  
      <p>
        Green Circle Solutions respects your privacy and is committed to handling personal information
        responsibly and transparently. This page explains what information is collected, how it is
        used, and the boundaries that apply.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Information collected</h2>
  
      <p>
        Information is collected only when you choose to provide it. This typically occurs when you
        contact us directly via email.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The information collected may include your name, email address, organisation name, location,
        and any high-level context you choose to share. You are not required to provide sensitive
        personal, financial, or confidential information at the initial contact stage.
      </p>
  
      <h2>How information is used</h2>
  
      <p>
        Information provided is used solely to respond to enquiries, assess whether a collection or
        service arrangement may be appropriate, and manage communication.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Information is not used for advertising, profiling, automated decision-making, or resale.
        Green Circle Solutions does not operate marketing mailing lists, behavioural tracking, or
        automated outreach systems.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Data storage and handling</h2>
  
      <p>
        Submitted information is stored using standard email and document-handling tools. These
        services apply their own security and privacy practices.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Reasonable care is taken to prevent unauthorised access or misuse. However, no internet-based
        system can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Third-party services</h2>
  
      <p>
        This website does not intentionally use tracking cookies, analytics platforms, or advertising
        pixels. Where third-party services are used to support communication or operations, information
        is subject to the privacy policies of those providers.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Information sharing</h2>
  
      <p>
        Personal information is not sold, rented, or shared with third parties, except where required
        by law or where necessary to support basic operational or communication processes.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Retention</h2>
  
      <p>
        Information is retained only for as long as reasonably necessary to manage communication or
        assess potential services. You may request deletion of your information at any time.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Your rights</h2>
  
      <p>
        You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information by contacting
        us via the Contact page.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Policy updates</h2>
  
      <p>
        This privacy policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in practice or regulatory
        expectations. Continued use of the site indicates acceptance of the current version.
