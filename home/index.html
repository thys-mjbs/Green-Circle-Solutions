      <h2>The operational gap</h2>
      <p>
        Recycling breaks down when collection, storage, and resale are not
        connected. Material accumulates, value drops, and effort increases.

    <div class="feature-text">
      <h2>Structured collection</h2>
      <p>
        We create predictable collection routines aligned with how your
        operation actually runs. No theory. Just movement.

      <h2>Material flow clarity</h2>
      <p>
        Handling standards, sorting expectations, and resale pathways are
        agreed upfront. Friction reduces. Value is preserved.

      <h2>Built to scale</h2>
      <p>
        Today it is collection and routing. Tomorrow it can extend into
        processing, consolidation, and value-added material use.
