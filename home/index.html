          Practical recycling collection<br>
          built around real-world operations
        </h1>

        <p>
          Many businesses and individuals generate recyclable material consistently,
          yet struggle to manage it efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Storage fills up. Collections are irregular. Materials lose value through poor handling or delays.
          Effort increases, not because people are careless, but because the collection and resale process
          is unclear or fragmented.
        </p>

        <p>
          Green Circle Solutions provides straightforward collection and material-handling services that move
          recyclable materials reliably from source to appropriate recycling and buy-back channels,
          reducing friction and unnecessary waste.

    <!-- TRUST / QUICK FACTS -->
    <section>
      <h2>What we focus on</h2>
      <p>
        Reliable pickup. Clear handling standards. Direct delivery into established recycling routes.
        Simple operational agreements that reduce back-and-forth.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Businesses: ongoing collections aligned to your storage capacity and operating hours</li>
        <li>Collectors: a clear channel for selling sorted material (where feasible)</li>
        <li>Buy-back and recycling partners: consistent inbound material with known condition</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- PROBLEM -->
    <section>
      <h2>The problem this addresses</h2>
      <p>
        Inefficient recycling is rarely caused by a lack of intent.
        It emerges from gaps between collection, storage, transport, and resale.
      </p>
      <p>
        When those links are unclear or unreliable, recyclable material accumulates, effort increases,
        and value is gradually lost.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- WHAT IT IS / IS NOT -->
    <section>
      <h2>What this is (and is not)</h2>
      <p>
        This is a practical collection and handling service. It is not consulting, compliance advisory, or certification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each arrangement focuses on collecting, transporting, and delivering recyclable materials based on agreed
        handling requirements and operational realities.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a material cannot be moved profitably or responsibly, we will say so upfront.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- MATERIALS -->
    <section>
      <h2>Materials we can typically handle</h2>
      <p>
        This varies by partner demand, contamination risk, and load size. Use this as a placeholder list.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>PET bottles (clear and coloured, subject to condition)</li>
        <li>HDPE containers and bottles (subject to sorting and cleanliness)</li>
        <li>LDPE film and shrink wrap (subject to contamination)</li>
        <li>Cardboard and paper (dry only)</li>
        <li>Selected metals (subject to grading)</li>
        <li>Glass (collection rules vary by site and breakage risk)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Placeholder note: Replace with your confirmed accepted materials list per region and partner.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
    <section>
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Initial contact</strong>: you tell us what you have, roughly how much, and how it is stored.</li>
        <li><strong>Handling rules</strong>: we confirm what must be separated, what must stay dry, and what is rejected.</li>
        <li><strong>Collection plan</strong>: once-off or recurring pickups based on volume and location.</li>
        <li><strong>Pickup and transfer</strong>: we collect, weigh where applicable, and route to the correct outlet.</li>
        <li><strong>Ongoing adjustment</strong>: if volumes change, the plan changes. No complicated structure.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- WHO IT IS FOR -->
    <section>
      <h2>Who this is for</h2>

      <h3>Businesses</h3>
      <p>
        Businesses generating recyclables through day-to-day operations that want a consistent way to remove and redirect it.
        Especially where space, time, or staff bandwidth make self-managed recycling unreliable.
      </p>

      <h3>Collectors and informal reclaimers</h3>
      <p>
        Individuals or small teams collecting sorted recyclables who need a clear, practical route to sell material
        that meets basic handling standards.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- WHAT YOU RECEIVE -->
    <section>
      <h2>What you receive</h2>
      <p>
        A practical collection arrangement that provides:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reliable removal of recyclable material</li>
        <li>Clear handling expectations and rejection rules</li>
        <li>Appropriate transport and delivery into recycling channels</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The value is reduced friction, improved consistency, and better odds that material stays within the recycling economy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- COVERAGE -->
    <section>
      <h2>Collection area</h2>
      <p>
        Placeholder: Johannesburg and surrounding areas. Replace this once your actual coverage is confirmed.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Primary: Johannesburg metro</li>
        <li>Secondary: Surrounding nodes based on route viability</li>
        <li>Ad hoc: Larger loads by arrangement</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- FAQ (NO JS REQUIRED) -->
    <section>
      <h2>Common questions</h2>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Do you pay for recyclables?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          Placeholder: It depends on material type, cleanliness, sorting, and volume. In some cases there is a buy-back value.
          In other cases there is no value and removal may carry a cost. This is confirmed before pickup.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Do you collect mixed recycling?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          Placeholder: Mixed loads usually reduce value and increase rejection risk. If mixed collection is possible, it will be
          under specific rules. Assume separation is required unless confirmed otherwise.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>How often can you collect?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          Placeholder: Once-off and recurring options. Frequency depends on volume and route density.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>What makes material unacceptable?</strong></summary>
        <p>
          Typical issues: wet cardboard, food contamination, mixed plastics, excessive labels, hazardous residue, broken glass without containment.
          Final rules depend on the receiving facility.

      <h2>Start with a simple description</h2>
      <p>
        Send what you have, roughly how much, where it is located, and how it is stored.
