        Practical recycling collection<br>
        built around real-world operations
      </h1>

      <p>
        Many businesses and individuals generate recyclable material
        consistently, yet struggle to manage it efficiently.
      </p>

      <p>
        Storage fills up. Collections are irregular.
        Materials lose value through poor handling or delays.
        Effort increases because the collection and resale process
        is unclear or fragmented.
      </p>

      <p>
        Green Circle Solutions provides straightforward collection
        and material-handling services that move recyclable materials
        reliably into appropriate recycling and buy-back channels.
      </p>

  <!-- SECTION 1 -->
  <section>
    <h2>The structural gap</h2>

    <p>
      Inefficient recycling is rarely caused by lack of intent.
      It emerges from gaps between collection, storage, transport,
      and resale.
    </p>

    <p>
      When those links are unclear or unreliable, recyclable material
      accumulates, effort increases, and value is gradually lost.
    </p>

    <h2>What this is (and is not)</h2>

    <p>
      This is a practical collection and handling service.
      It is not consulting, compliance advisory, or certification.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each engagement focuses on collecting, transporting,
      and delivering recyclable materials based on agreed
      arrangements and operational realities.
    </p>

    <h2>Who this is for</h2>

    <p>
      Businesses and individuals who generate recyclable materials
      as part of daily operations and want a reliable way to
      remove and redirect that material.
    </p>
  </section>


  <!-- SECTION 2 -->
  <section>
    <h2>What you receive</h2>

    <p>
      A clear, practical collection arrangement that provides:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Reliable removal of recyclable material</li>
      <li>Appropriate handling and transport</li>
      <li>Delivery into established recycling channels</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why this approach</h2>

    <p>
      Recycling only works when collection and resale function
      as a connected system.
    </p>

    <p>
      By keeping the process simple, visible, and repeatable,
      recycling becomes easier to maintain without adding
      operational burden.
