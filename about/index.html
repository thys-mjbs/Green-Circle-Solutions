          <h1>About Green Circle Solutions</h1>
       
          <p>
            Green Circle Solutions was established with a clear view: once material has been extracted, processed, and manufactured into usable products, discarding it without recovery is a loss of value.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Recycling, when structured properly, is not symbolic. It is operational. It protects embedded value and reduces unnecessary strain on supply systems.
          </p>

      <p>
        The company focuses on disciplined collection, predictable handling, and responsible material flow. By connecting collection with structured downstream channels, materials are kept circulating within the economy rather than defaulting to disposal.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        We view material recovery as part of a broader responsibility. Resources are finite. Systems must become more efficient over time, not less.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Green Circle Solutions is committed to building practical, repeatable infrastructure within the recyclable materials space. The objective is steady improvement through disciplined operations, clear standards, and structured material movement.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The work is simple in principle: collect properly, handle correctly, and ensure materials retain value wherever possible.
