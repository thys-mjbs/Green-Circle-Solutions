          <h1>What the service covers</h1>
      
          <p>
            Green Circle Solutions provides a structured and practical recycling
            collection arrangement. The objective is simple: make recycling removal
            predictable, easy, and frictionless without adding operational burden.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            We provide durable refuse bags for recyclable materials. You separate
            agreed recyclables into those bags as part of your normal routine.
            The process is designed to integrate into existing operations rather
            than disrupt them.

      <h2>Collection and removal</h2>
  
      <p>
        Once engaged, we determine the appropriate collection frequency based
        on your volume and space constraints. Bags can be stored in standard
        wheelie bins or designated holding areas until collection.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        We then collect, transport, and route those materials into appropriate
        recycling and buy-back channels. Collections take place at the agreed frequency, with flexibility to adjust if volumes increase or your operational needs change.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Sorting and material standards</h2>
  
      <p>
        During engagement, we clarify which materials are accepted, how they
        should be separated, and what condition is required to preserve value.
        Expectations are agreed upfront to avoid rejection, contamination,
        or unnecessary handling.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The goal is consistency. Clear standards reduce friction and prevent
        recyclable material from degrading into landfill-bound waste.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Operational simplicity</h2>
  
      <p>
        The service exists to be quick, seamless, and practical. You separate.
        We collect. The materials move back into the circular economy.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        In many environments, municipal services are inconsistent or unreliable.
        A private, structured arrangement reduces overflow, lowers waste
        pressure, and can contribute to reduced refuse-related costs over time.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Enterprise and scale</h2>
  
      <p>
        For larger operations or enterprise-level engagements, collection,
        handling, and routing can be structured in greater detail. Volume,
        batching, storage, and routing can be aligned with operational scale.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        If your material flow requires a more tailored structure, we can
        discuss a practical arrangement suited to your specific footprint.
