          <h1>Structured recycling collection</h1>
      
          <p>
            Collection arrangements are structured based on your operational requirements, including appropriate containment solutions where necessary, with recyclable materials and separation standards agreed upfront. Cardboard, paper, and selected plastics can be accommodated depending on volume and condition.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            You separate materials as part of your normal routine. We determine a suitable collection frequency based on your volume, storage capacity, and operational footprint.

      <h2>Collection and handling</h2>
  
      <p>
        Collections take place at agreed intervals based on your operational needs. Where required, ad hoc collections can also be facilitated. Materials are collected, transported, and directed into appropriate recycling and material channels through structured handling and routing.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        If volumes increase or your requirements change, arrangements can be adjusted accordingly.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Material standards</h2>
  
      <p>
        Clear standards protect value. During engagement, we confirm what is accepted, how it must be separated, and the condition required. This prevents contamination, rejection, and unnecessary handling.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Consistency reduces waste and protects the recoverable value within the material stream.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Extended material engagement</h2>
  
      <p>
        In addition to collection, we operate across recyclable materials and related material channels, including downstream resale where appropriate. Where suitable, material flows can be structured beyond simple removal to support broader recovery and reintroduction into supply chains.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        If your operation requires a more tailored arrangement, we can structure a practical solution aligned with your scale and material output.
